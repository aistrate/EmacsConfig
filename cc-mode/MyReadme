To compile CC Mode from the shell, run this from the cc-mode directory:

    $ emacs -batch -no-site-file -q -f batch-byte-compile cc-*.el

To test that you have things set up correctly, visit a C file and then type:

    M-x c-version
    => Using CC Mode version 5.XX

where XX is the correct minor revision number (5.31.7).
